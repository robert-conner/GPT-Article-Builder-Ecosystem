## Description
The GPT Article Builder Ecosystem is an innovative tool designed to automate the creation of well-researched, SEO-optimized articles. At its core, this ecosystem leverages the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to intelligently generate articles that are not only relevant and engaging but also rooted in authoritative sources. The system uses multiple instances of ChatGPT, where the first acts like a Project Manager and organizes the article as it is written and provides indepth tasks sequentially to the second instance. This leaves the second instance performing the majority of the writing tasks.

Utilizing a sophisticated blend of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and prompt engineering, the system efficiently extracts and synthesizes information from a curated corpus of documents. This process ensures that each article is backed by credible information, with proper citations to original sources, enhancing the article's reliability and usefulness.

## Features
- Automated Content Generation: Harness the capability to produce articles on a wide range of topics with minimal human intervention, significantly reducing the time and effort required for content creation.
- SEO Optimization: Incorporates SEO best practices in the article generation process, ensuring that the content not only reads well but is also optimized for search engines.
- Source Credibility: By integrating direct citations from the sourced documents, the ecosystem maintains a high standard of credibility and authenticity in the information presented.
- Customizable Workflow: Offers flexibility in content creation, allowing for tailored prompts and adjustable parameters to suit different needs and preferences.

## How It Works
- Content Extraction: The system begins by extracting content from .docx files, utilizing a predefined list of sources to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- Dataframe Generation: Extracted content is structured into a dataframe, facilitating easy manipulation and analysis of the information.
- Text Analysis and Modification: Implements various NLP techniques to refine the text, including splitting text based on common delimiters and merging related paragraphs for cohesiveness.
- Tokenization and Plotting: Analyzes the modified text to count tokens, aiding in the assessment of content quality and distribution.
- Interactive Bot Interface: Users interact with a bot trained on the processed data, allowing for dynamic article generation based on specific prompts or subjects.
  - The bot will first create an outline for the article. This outline is then used to generate the singular tasks for the second instance.
  - These tasks are provided to the second instance, which writes that section using the source material provided, allowing the first instance to modify and reorganize the output to better suit the article flow and SEO.
